<h1>Best Movies by BJ Rupan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Silence of the lambs</h3>
<p>It is ranked as no1 in my top 3 movies because of how good the movie is directed, the thrill factor from the very first min of the movie to 
    last min. Well directed and produced movie with the most realistic aspect and a good twist at the climax scene </p>
<h3>The Interstellar</h3>
<p>It would also be my top 1 movies easily just because how briliant it is and how good the movie was written and its screenplay.
    you wouldn't even feel like this only about science or space. It embraces how beautiful the relationship is between a daughter and her father.
</p>  
<h3>Catch me if you can</h3>
<p>Hands down one of the best biography films of all time. Again the thrill factor from the start to end and a well put together screenplay by none other than Martin scorcesse</p>
